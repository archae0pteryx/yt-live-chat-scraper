## YouTube Live chat scraper w/ Casperjs
NO LONGER MAINTAINED.
This was one of my first attempts at scraping and have learned much since. You can see my more updated scraper. I am also working on a library specifically for youtube scraping but that's far from being anywhere share worthy.


My original idea was to have the scraper listen for racist or otherwise nasty sentiments and respod with some loving message as well as log the user.

With Yarn (for npm use ```npm``` instead of ```yarn```)

```yarn install```

```yarn start```

```yarn test```

Replace the URL in scraper.js with a youtube live chat stream of your choosing. Just use the popout url from your stream.
I just added the words.js occurrence functionality. I am still hashing this out now and if you want to test you'll need to point the words.js file to a log you want to scrape
